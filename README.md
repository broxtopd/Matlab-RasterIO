# Matlab-RasterIO
These functions use gdal to read and write raster data into Matlab (including providing functionality to 
subset, resize, and reproject the raster files before they are read).  These functions require that GDAL 
and a python distribution with GDAL bindings are installed and accessable via the command line.
